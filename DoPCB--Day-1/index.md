# DoPCB / Day 1

Design of Printed Circuit Boards with KiCad ( DoPCB )

---

## structure

- skills
- sorry for the delay
- 3CP
- RB + DPP + Felix Fisgus

### sessions

every day consists of first a *lecture+meetup* session ( in room *2.11.100* ) and then a *workshop* session ( on MS Teams and in parallel in room *2.11.100* ).

### assignments

there are assignments after each *lecture+meetup* session. these assignments need to be completed in order to finish the class. this can either be done in the following *workshop* session or later that same day.

### deliverable

the class is completed by delivering a completed, *functional* and *artistic* design as KiCad files until 2021-10-17 23:59

## INTRODUCTION (13:00–14:30)

"today we will have a brief introdcution to PCBs + KiCad + PCLibrary"

---

### Introduction to PCBs

- Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
- anatomy of PCBs ( layers, pads, shapes )
- some examples ( https://dennisppaul.de )

---

#### Why making PCBs?

- small(er)
- *resilient* to physical stress, corrosion and short circuits
- replication
- Surface Mount Device (SMD) or Surface Mount Technology (SMT) become available
- structural element ( PCB as *case* or *final product* )
- silkscreen layer + PCB colors

---

#### Why having PCBs produced?

- … and why now?
- software became accessible
- drop in production cost
- assembly

---

### Introduction to KiCad

- 30 year old, open source, CAD software #CERN
- [KiCad Website](https://www.kicad.org)
- [KiCad @ Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiCad)

#### KiCad Basic Paradigm

- breadboard
- schematic
- symbol-to-footprint
    - symbol == schematic
    - footprint == PCB
- PCB layout

#### Learning Resources

- [KiCad Website: Getting Started](https://docs.kicad.org/5.1/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html)
- [Shawn Hymel: KiCad Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3bNyZYHcRSUhUXUt51W6nKvxx2ORvUQB) #youtube #digikey #bowtie
- [Contextual Electronics (Chris Gemmell): Getting To Blinky 5.0](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2022BX6EspFAKBCgRuEuzapuz_4aJCn) #youtube
- [KiCad Forum](https://forum.kicad.info)
- next session: "DESIGNING PCBs"

### Introduction to Physical Computing Library (PCLib or PCL)

- Physical Computing Library (PCLib or PCL)
- [Physical Computing Library @ DM](https://pcl.digitalmedia-bremen.de)

### Assignment

- install KiCad
- watch Shawn Hymel + Chris Gemmell
