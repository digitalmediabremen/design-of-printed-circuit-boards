# DoPCB / Day 5

---

## BYO DESIGN (10:00–12:00)

"today ~~we will~~ you did bring your own design (BYOD) and we realize it in KiCad"

---

### assignment

bring a circuit design that you want to realsize in KiCad. ideally the circuit is based on something you have built already ( maybe last semester’s project ) or a circuit that you know works.

realize this design in KiCad as schematic + PCB and prepare output files for PCB assembly at JLCPCB. deliver a completed fully *functional*, *beautiful*, *ugly*, *artistic* and/or interesting design.

please upload the files in a ZIP file named `dopcb--` + your first name + last name ( e.g `dopcb--dennisppaul.zip` ) into MS Teams under [files](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3779e6c121a749108d4f147963ccc5bb%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=60c90c3d-c1b4-440e-af36-2c29c6e28a83&tenantId=09e769ef-38f0-4cf4-a9e2-194cccd24761) until 2021-10-17 23:59.

### fallback

if you really do not know what you want to do. you can do this:

deliver an anthropomorphic design including a ATmega328P MCU ( programmable via ISP ) + 1 rotary encoder ( with interrupts ) + 4 LEDs indivdually controllable via MCU.
